mCLARI was developed for the IROS 2023 paper *"A shape-morphing insect-scale robot capable of omnidirectional terrain-adaptive locomotion in laterally confined spaces"*
The main CAD files for this version are found in **mCLARI_01**. For most purposes and needs this is the version you want to use and look at.

Further concept designs with slight design changes are in **mCLARI_01.2** and **mCLARI_01.2_concepts**.
Rough design replanning was done in **mCLARI_02**, yet this project was abandoned and not finished.
